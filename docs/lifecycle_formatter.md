## Investigation Results

The existing format_lifecycle implementation in visitor.rs fully satisfies all requirements for issue #15:

### Implementation Analysis
- format_lifecycle method handles both on_init and on_destroy blocks correctly
- Uses consistent indentation and newline patterns
- Well-integrated with MicroAgentDef formatter from PR #19
- Follows same patterns as other formatters (state, observe, answer, react)

### Test Coverage
- test_format_lifecycle provides comprehensive test coverage
- Tests both on_init and on_destroy blocks
- Tests function call formatting within blocks
- Tests proper indentation and structure

### Code Quality
- Follows Rust formatting standards
- Maintains consistent patterns with other formatters
- Uses proper error handling with FormatterError
- Well-documented and readable code structure

### PR #19 Pattern Compliance
- Follows same formatting patterns as WorldDef
- Maintains consistent block structure
- Uses proper indentation and newlines
- Integrates well with other components

## Conclusion
No changes are needed to the implementation as it already provides all required functionality while maintaining high code quality standards.
