# Design vs Implementation Analysis

## 1. Declarative Development (DSL)
Current Implementation:
- Basic event enum generation in core/types.rs
- Tokenizer and AST implementation present
- Formatter implementation available

Design Gaps:
- Initial design had more extensive DSL features
- Some planned DSL syntax elements not yet implemented
- Integration between World and MicroAgent DSL needs strengthening

## 2. Three-Layer Architecture
Current Implementation:
- Native Layer: Well-defined in native_feature/
- Plugin Layer: Extensive provider/ implementation
- MicroAgent Layer: Basic implementation in agent_registry/

Design Gaps:
- Plugin layer more extensive than initially designed
- Native layer features more focused than original design
- Layer boundaries less strict than initial design

## 3. Event-Based Processing
Current Implementation:
- Basic event system (event/mod.rs)
- Event bus and registry implementation
- Request manager present

Design Gaps:
- Simpler event model than initially designed
- Event types more limited than original specification
- Some planned event patterns not implemented

## 4. LLM Integration
Current Implementation:
- Provider interface in provider/
- LLM-specific modules in provider/llms/
- Plugin system for providers

Design Gaps:
- More modular than initial design
- Provider capabilities evolved beyond initial spec
- Different approach to LLM abstraction

## 5. Type System
Current Implementation:
- Visitor pattern implementation
- Type context and scope management
- Plugin configuration validation

Design Gaps:
- More sophisticated type checking than initial design
- Plugin-specific type checking removed
- Error handling more streamlined

## Key Observations
1. Implementation has evolved to be more modular
2. Plugin system more prominent than initial design
3. Type system more sophisticated than originally planned
4. Event system simpler but more focused
5. Layer boundaries more flexible than initial design
