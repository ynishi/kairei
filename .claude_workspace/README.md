# Claude Workspace

This directory serves as Claude's workspace for drafting files, creating temporary content, and developing ideas without affecting the main repository.

## Purpose

- Safe space for Claude to create drafts of issues, PRs, documentation
- Temporary storage for work-in-progress files
- Testing area for scripts and features
- Staging area for content before it's moved to the main repository

## Usage

Files in this directory won't interfere with the main codebase and are primarily for Claude's use during development sessions. The entire directory is excluded from git via .gitignore.

Feel free to ask Claude to create or modify files in this workspace as needed.
