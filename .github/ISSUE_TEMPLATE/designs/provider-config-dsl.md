# Provider Configuration DSL Design

## Overview
This design issue explores the feasibility and value of implementing a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) or YAML-based configuration for Provider LLM integration in KAIREI. The goal is to make it easier for contributors to extend KAIREI with new provider implementations without modifying core code, similar to browser extensions or GitHub Actions ecosystem.

## Current Architecture
The current Provider configuration system in KAIREI is implemented as a Rust native module with the following characteristics:

- Well-defined Provider trait interface with lifecycle methods
- Support for multiple provider types (OpenAIAssistant, SimpleExpert, OpenAIChat)
- Plugin architecture for Memory, RAG, and Search capabilities
- Configuration through nested Rust structs with Serde serialization
- Extensive validation mechanisms for type safety and configuration correctness

### Key Components

1. **Provider Trait**
   - Defines the interface for all providers
   - Includes lifecycle methods (init, send_message, etc.)
   - Supports capability reporting and validation

2. **Configuration System**
   - Hierarchical configuration with base and provider-specific options
   - Plugin configurations (Memory, RAG, Search)
   - Validation through the `ConfigValidation` trait
   - Dynamic configuration via `HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>`

3. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Modular extension of provider capabilities
   - Priority-based execution
   - Capability matching for plugin selection

## Problem Statement
While the current system is powerful and type-safe, it presents a high barrier to entry for contributors who want to extend KAIREI with new provider implementations. Contributors currently need to:

1. Understand the Rust Provider trait interface
2. Implement provider-specific configuration structures
3. Write validation logic for their configurations
4. Integrate with the provider registry
5. Modify core code to add their provider

This complexity limits the potential for a vibrant ecosystem of provider implementations and extensions.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a DSL or YAML-based configuration system for Provider LLM integration with the following features:

### Option 1: YAML-based Configuration
```yaml
provider:
  type: openai_chat
  name: my_openai_provider
  config:
    model: gpt-4
    temperature: 0.7
  plugins:
    memory:
      enabled: true
      max_tokens: 1000
    search:
      enabled: true
      max_results: 5
```

### Option 2: Simplified Domain-Specific Language
```
provider OpenAIChat MyProvider {
  model: "gpt-4"
  temperature: 0.7
  
  memory {
    enabled: true
    max_tokens: 1000
  }
  
  search {
    enabled: true
    max_results: 5
  }
}
```

## Implementation Approach

### Parser Implementation
1. Create a parser that converts DSL/YAML to Rust configuration structures
   - For YAML: Use serde_yaml for deserialization
   - For custom DSL: Implement a custom parser (potentially using nom or pest)

2. Configuration Mapping
   - Map DSL/YAML fields to corresponding Rust structs
   - Handle nested configurations for plugins
   - Support dynamic fields through HashMaps

### Validation Integration
1. Maintain the existing validation mechanisms
   - Apply ConfigValidation trait methods to parsed configurations
   - Collect and report validation errors with source locations
   - Support both compile-time and runtime validation

### Registry Integration
1. Extend the provider registry to support DSL-based providers
   - Add methods to load providers from DSL/YAML files
   - Support dynamic provider registration
   - Maintain backward compatibility with native providers

### Migration Path
1. Provide a clear migration path for existing configurations
   - Generate DSL/YAML from existing Rust configurations
   - Support both native and DSL-based providers simultaneously
   - Document the migration process

## Complexity Assessment

| Aspect | Complexity | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Parser Implementation | Moderate | YAML parsing is straightforward with serde_yaml; custom DSL would require more effort |
| Type Safety | Low | Can leverage existing validation mechanisms |
| Configuration Mapping | Low | Straightforward with Serde |
| Validation | Low | Can reuse existing validation logic |
| Integration | Moderate | Requires changes to provider registry |
| Documentation | Moderate | Comprehensive documentation needed for contributors |

## Value Assessment

| Aspect | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Contributor Experience | High | Significantly lowers barrier to entry |
| Extensibility | High | Enables easier creation of new providers |
| Ecosystem Potential | High | Similar to browser extensions or GitHub Actions |
| Maintenance | Medium | Slightly increased complexity but manageable |
| Alignment | High | Consistent with KAIREI's architectural goals |

## Recommendation
Based on the analysis, implementing a **YAML-based Provider configuration system** is **recommended** for the following reasons:

1. It significantly lowers the barrier to entry for contributors
2. The implementation complexity is moderate and manageable
3. Existing type safety and validation can be maintained
4. It aligns with the project's goal of creating an extensible ecosystem
5. It provides a clear path for future WASM support

YAML is preferred over a custom DSL for the initial implementation because:
1. It leverages existing Serde serialization/deserialization
2. It has lower implementation complexity
3. It is widely understood by developers
4. It can be extended to support a custom DSL in the future if needed

## Next Steps
1. Create a prototype parser for YAML-to-Rust configuration conversion
2. Implement validation for the YAML configuration
3. Update the provider registry to support DSL-based providers
4. Create documentation and examples for contributors
5. Develop a migration guide for existing providers

## Open Questions
1. Should we support both YAML and a custom DSL, or focus on one approach?
2. How should we handle versioning of the configuration format?
3. Should we provide tooling to validate configurations before runtime?
4. How should we handle provider-specific configuration options that may not be known at compile time?
5. What is the best approach for error reporting in the DSL/YAML parser?
